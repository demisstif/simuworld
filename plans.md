# Plans

Simuworld is not a short-term project, it may last for many years, even my entire programming career. So simuworld has a lot of time. However, simuworld is a creative project. There is no criterion for success or failure. It does not know what knowledge and technology it involves. So without a guiding plan, simuworld may eventually be forgotten in the corner of the gray layer.

The only thing that doesn't change is the change itself.

## Phase 0:Accumulation

In phase 0, the plan is like this:

1. Read and practice The Nature of Code.
2. The Internet hand collects information related to the "simulated world".

The goal of Phase 0 is to understand exactly which step humans have taken in simulating the world. After stage 0, you can continue to explore on the shoulders of the predecessors.

Stage 0 will have a biweekly report to record the two weeks of harvest and progress.
