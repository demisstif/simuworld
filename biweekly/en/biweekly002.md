# simuworld biweekly 002

It has been almost three months since the last weekly report. The development of this project has been delayed due to the problems in life and work. But the more important reason is that without a goal, there is no step. Now I have some free time, just to make up.

The purpose of simuworld is to simulate the real world to the maximum extent, but if the goal at the beginning is like this, it is really difficult. People don't know where to start. In the past three months, I finished the Open World game, which involved a lot of things that simulate the world. The game is something I touched, and one thing that is closest to the simulated world is also inspired.

Simulating the real world is really a bad start, then lower the target to simulate some small worlds. Such as automatic cellular machines.

After setting the rules, we must consider how to achieve them. Now I want to write this program in the rust language. In the next two weeks, I decided to take the time to define a small world rule and then implement it in the rust language. The direction is modeled after the cellular machine.
