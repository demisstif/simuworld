# Simuworld Biweekly 000


> [Simuworld](https://github.com/demisstif/simuworld) is a project dedicated to simulating the real world through computers. It has only just begun. Here is a biweekly report, recording the progress of the project within two weeks, sharing ideas .

The two weeks spent on this project are not a lot of time, on the one hand because of work, on the other hand, because the planning of this project is not detailed enough. It leads to the unknown. The next time should be planned more comprehensive, step by step project. Go ahead and advance.

Some thoughts and gains in these two weeks:

## Thinking

In the analog world, there have been some interesting projects. Now I have found that mainly in the field of games, such as Dwarf Fortress and Minecraft. These simulations of the world have a common trait, need Player participation, as the main and even the only variable in the world. This is obviously different from the complex operation of the real world.

What should be the essence of the world? From ordinary objects to atoms, from atoms to quarks. The essence of the world is a series of interactions of particles from the perspective of the onlookers. If the basic particles are determined, they know their respective properties, Then it should be possible to deduce a world. Perhaps? The origin of the material of the real world has not been scientifically explored. If you only consider reality in the world of simulation, it may be difficult to achieve.

In the simple philosophy, everything can be composed of the earth and the fire. Can you build a world by referring to this simple philosophy when simulating the world? Assuming that these views of ancient philosophy can be greatly simplified, the basic composition of the world can be greatly simplified. Turning the basic material into single digits. Of course, if you use this method, the result of the simulation must not be realistic. The point is whether you can define a set of self-consistent rules through the elements of ancient philosophy. In the real world, on the surface The world is in a variety of ways, but in the end, the same path is the same. The water and fire are instantiated into four basic particles, defining their volume, quality and other properties. Different amounts of different substances, the substance shows different properties. How much does this require? The original rules can make it run spontaneously?

The interpretation of the world by ancient philosophy is obviously not correct. But as a theoretical source of the simulated world, it cannot be ignored. After all, it is impossible to completely simulate the real world in computers, because humans still don't know much about the real world.

The living body, especially the intelligent living body, is also composed of the basic material from the material point of view, but their composition is really difficult to be simulated, because now it is not known what the bottom is.


## Technology

Found an application development framework for the golang language: fyne.io. Can be used as a tool for writing world visualizations in the golang language.

Microsoft launched a Minecraft-based artificial intelligence test and research platform [malmo](https://github.com/Microsoft/malmo)
